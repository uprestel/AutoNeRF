    """Given a nested list or dict return the desired value at key expanding
    callable nodes if necessary and :attr:`expand` is ``True``. The expansion
    is done in-place.
    Parameters
    ----------
        list_or_dict : list or dict
            Possibly nested list or dictionary.
        key : str
            key/to/value, path like string describing all keys necessary to
            consider to get to the desired value. List indices can also be
            passed here.
        splitval : str
            String that defines the delimiter between keys of the
            different depth levels in `key`.
        default : obj
            Value returned if :attr:`key` is not found.
        expand : bool
            Whether to expand callable nodes on the path or not.
    Returns
    -------
        The desired value or if :attr:`default` is not ``None`` and the
        :attr:`key` is not found returns ``default``.
    Raises
    ------
        Exception if ``key`` not in ``list_or_dict`` and :attr:`default` is
        ``None``.
